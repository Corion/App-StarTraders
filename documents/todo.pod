=head2 Game mechanics

=over 4

=item *

Implement a game director that places quests, items and
generates encounters and directs combats and other interactions.

This is partly the Demiurge, but maybe a separation of roles
between Demiurge, who creates and maintains the universe and
Game Director, who runs the interactions, is beneficial.

=item *

Implement resource spawners like mines or farms that "produce"
commodities without resources other than time. These could sell
exclusively to the trading posts on the planet or directly
to the player if the player has bought them. Maybe the trading
post itself should simply be owned by the player in such a case.

Those spawners should at least be linear, but potentially
consist of a gaussian distribution around the linear displacement,
to keep things interesting. Calculation whether to span a resource
now would be based on the last time something was produced.

Potentially both, the point in time as well as the amount
should follow some distribution.

=item *

Implement a universal time ticker that governs production
etc. across the universe for the playtime. All actions
would be tied to a point in time.

Is travel through wormholes instantaneous?

=item *

Implement resource transformation journal that trails how/when/where entities
enter and leave the system. This is easy for trade/exchange
but how are consumables handled? Should fuel consumption
issue one log entry per (instantaneous) trip or should it
issue multiple entries as the journey progresses? The same
issue arises with factories that consume raw materials
to produce refined materials.

Potentially, just like with The Account System, the amount of
raw and refined materials at a point in time is just the
sum of the journals for the place, at least up to the last
consolidation point. This would leave the burden of accounting
for the transformation with the transformator. If you start a
transformation and then interrupt or finish it, at that point
in time, the calculation needs to be updated with a new log
entry. This approach makes it harder to inspect the "current situation".
Maybe every such inspection causes a commit of the situation?
